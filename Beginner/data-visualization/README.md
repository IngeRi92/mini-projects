# Simple Data Analysis Tool

This Python project allows you to quickly analyze numerical data entered by the user. The program calculates basic statistics, displays a bar chart and a histogram in the terminal, and analyzes the trend of the data.

## Features

- **User input:** Enter a list of numbers and optional labels.
- **Statistics:** Calculates count, sum, mean, median, mode, minimum, maximum, range, and standard deviation (rounded to 3 decimal places).
- **Bar chart:** Visualizes your data as a simple text-based bar chart.
- **Histogram:** Shows the distribution of your data in value ranges ("bins").
- **Trend analysis:** Detects if the data is increasing, decreasing, stable, or variable.

## Usage

1. Run the script:
   ```
   python data_visualization.py
   ```
2. Enter your data as a comma-separated list (e.g., `10, 20, 15, 30`).
3. Optionally, enter labels for your data points.
4. View the calculated statistics and charts in the terminal.
5. Choose whether to analyze another dataset or exit.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x (no external libraries required, uses only the standard library)

## Notes

- All output is in Estonian.
- The program is intended for simple, quick data analysis in the terminal.
- Project for learning purposes.
